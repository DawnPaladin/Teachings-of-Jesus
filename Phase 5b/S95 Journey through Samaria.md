**[Luke 9:51-56](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+9.51-56&t=NIV)**  
51 It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem. 52 and sent messengers before his face. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. 53 They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. 54 When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?” 55 But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are. 56 For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” They went to another village.
