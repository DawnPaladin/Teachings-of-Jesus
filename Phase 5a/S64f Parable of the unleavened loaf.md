**[Matthew 13:33-35](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+13.33-35&t=NIV)**  
33 He spoke another parable to them. “The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.” 34 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them, 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”

**[Mark 4:33-34](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+4.33-34&t=NIV)**

33 With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. 34 Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
