1 Seeing the multitudes, he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him. 2 He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,

**[Luke 6:17-19](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.17-19&t=NIV)**  
17 He came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; 18 as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. 19 All the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.

3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. 10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. 11 “Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

**[Luke 6:20-26](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.20-26&t=NIV)**  
20 He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, “Blessed are you who are poor, God’s Kingdom is yours. 21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. 22 Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.

23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets. 24 “But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation. 25 Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. 26 Woe, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.

13 “You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. 14 You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. 15 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. 16 Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

17 “Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. 18 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. 19 Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

## Section 54e
### Murder
21  “You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder,[fn] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ 22  But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister[fn][fn] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’[fn] is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.

23  “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, 24  leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.

25  “Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26  Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

### Adultery
27  “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’[fn] 28  But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29  If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30  And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

### Divorce
31  “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’[fn] 32  But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

#adultery #divorce

### Oaths
33  “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’ 34  But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35  or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36  And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37  All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.[fn]

#oaths #honesty #commands

### Eye for Eye
38  “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’[fn] 39  But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 40  And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. 41  If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. 42  Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

#nonresistance #generosity #justice #openness #commands

### Love for Enemies
43  “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor[fn] and hate your enemy.’ 44  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45  that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

**[Luke 6:27-30](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.27-30&t=NIV); 32-36**  

27  “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28  bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 29  If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. 30  Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31  Do to others as you would have them do to you.

32  “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. 33  And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. 34  And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. 35  But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36  Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

### Giving to the Needy
1  “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

2  “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3  But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4  so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

### Prayer
5  “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6  But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7  And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8  Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

#commands #prayer #popularity #eternal-reward #hypocrisy #god/father 

9  “This, then, is how you should pray:

“ ‘Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
10  your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
11  Give us today our daily bread.
12  And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13  And lead us not into temptation,[fn]
but deliver us from the evil one.[fn]’

#kingdom-of-heaven #forgiveness #temptation #satan #deliverance #hunger-and-thirst 

14  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15  But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

### Fasting
16  “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 17  But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18  so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

19  “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

### Do Not Worry
25  “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26  Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27  Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[fn]?

28  “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29  Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30  If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31  So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32  For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33  But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34  Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

### Judging Others
1  “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

3  “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4  How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5  You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

6  “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.

**[Luke 6:37-42](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.37-42&t=NIV)**
37  “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. 38  Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”

39 He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? 40 The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

41  “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 42  How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

9  “Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10  Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 11  If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! 12  So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

### True and False Prophets

15  “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16  By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17  Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18  A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19  Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20  Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.

 **[Luke 6:43-45](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.43-49&t=NIV)**
43  “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. 44  Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. 45  A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.

Away from me, you evildoers!’

### The Wise and Foolish Builders

24  “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25  The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26  But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27  The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”

 **[Luke 6:46-49](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.43-49&t=NIV)**
46  “Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say? 47  As for everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like. 48  They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. 49  But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
