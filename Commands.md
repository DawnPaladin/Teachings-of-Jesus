# [[S37 Nature of the Galilean Ministry]]

17 From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, “Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.” 

14b preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom, 15 and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”

# [[S54 Sermon on the Mount]]

13 “You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men. 14 You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. 15 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house. 16 Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

21  “You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder,[fn] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ 22  But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister[fn][fn] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’[fn] is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.

23  “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, 24  leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.

25  “Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26  Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

27  “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’[fn] 28  But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29  If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30  And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

31  “It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’[fn] 32  But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

33  “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’ 34  But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35  or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. 36  And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. 37  All you need to say is simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.[fn]

38  “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’[fn] 39  But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. 40  And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. 41  If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. 42  Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

43  “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor[fn] and hate your enemy.’ 44  But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45  that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. 46  If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? 47  And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? 48  Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

27  “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28  bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. 29  If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. 30  Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. 31  Do to others as you would have them do to you.

32  “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. 33  And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. 34  And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. 35  But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36  Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

1  “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

2  “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3  But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4  so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

5  “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6  But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7  And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8  Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

16  “When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 17  But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18  so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

19  “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

25  “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26  Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27  Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life[fn]?

28  “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29  Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30  If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31  So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32  For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33  But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34  Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

1  “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

3  “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4  How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5  You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

6  “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.

**[Luke 6:37-42](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.37-42&t=NIV)**
37  “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. 38  Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”

39 He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? 40 The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.

41  “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 42  How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

7  “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 8  For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

9  “Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10  Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? 11  If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! 12  So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.

**[Luke 6:31](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.31&t=NIV)**
31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.

13  “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14  But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

15  “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16  By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17  Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18  A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19  Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20  Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.

 **[Luke 6:43-45](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+6.43-49&t=NIV)**
43  “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. 44  Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. 45  A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.

# [[S70a Shortage of workers]]

35 Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. 36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. 38 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”

# [[S70b Appointing of the Twelve Apostles]]

5 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 6 Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. 7 As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,[fn] drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.

# [[S83 Take up your cross]]

23 He said to all, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. 24 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, will save it. 25 For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?

# [[S90 Greatest in the Kingdom]]

1 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” 2 Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in the middle of them, 3 and said, “Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. 4 Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. 5 Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me.

# [[S102a Commissioning the 72]]

1 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two[fn] others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. 2 He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. 3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.

5  “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ 6  If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. 7  Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.

8  “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. 9  Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 10  But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 11  ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’ 12  I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. 

# [[S103 The Good Samaritan]]

25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

26 “What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?” 

27 He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’[fn]; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[fn]”

28 “You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”

29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”

30 In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii[fn] and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’ 

36  “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”

37 The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.”

Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”

# [[S105 The Lord's Prayer]]

2 He said to them, “When you pray, say: 

> “ ‘Father,
> hallowed be your name,
> your kingdom come.
> 3  Give us each day our daily bread.
> 4  Forgive us our sins,
> for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.
> And lead us not into temptation.’ ” 

9  “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 10  For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 

# [[S106 On Satan, Demons, and Unbelief]]

“No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. 34  Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy,[fn] your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy,[fn] your body also is full of darkness. 35  See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. 36  Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”

# [[S108a Hypocrisy, secrets, worry, Holy Spirit]]

1 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: “Be[fn] on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2 There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. 3 What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.

4  “I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. 5  But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. 6  Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 7  Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 

11  “When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, 12  for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.”

# [[S108b Money and God's provision]]

15 Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”

22 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 24 Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 25 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life[fn]? 26 Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?

27  “Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28  If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of little faith! 29  And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30  For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31  But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. 

32  “Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 33  Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

# [[S108c Readiness]]

35  “Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, 36  like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. 37  It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. 38  It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak. 39  But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. 40  You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”

# [[S117c Sin, Faith, Duty]]

“If your brother or sister[fn] sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. 4  Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”
