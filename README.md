# Teachings of Jesus

Everyone these days wants Jesus on their side. Christians of every stripe claim that their favorite issue is the one Jesus cared about most. This repository is a very unscientific attempt to determine **what Jesus cared about most**, using what he *did* most and *talked* about most as a proxy.

## Methodology

I read through [this Harmony of the Gospels](http://harmony.bible/harmony-of-the-gospels/), copy-and-pasting each section into Markdown files in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. Each time Jesus mentioned a topic, I added a hashtag for that topic to that section's file.

Deciding how to "chunk" the hashtags is very subjective. When the same conversation is covered by multiple gospels, I will only tag it once. I also don't tag every single time Jesus says a word; I will usually tag once per paragraph at most. If Jesus wanders away from a topic and then comes back to it, I'll then tag it a second time. The goal isn't to deeply understand what Jesus is saying in any particular verse--it's to accumulate enough quantitative data that rough trends about his favorite topics will appear.

## Special hashtags

Most of the tags are topics of conversation, with a few exceptions:

- #commands are direct instructions from Jesus for all of his followers. Instructions for a particular time and place (e.g. "bring me a donkey for the Triumphal Entry") are excluded.
- #miracles are sometimes an example of Jesus talking about miracles and sometimes a miracle happening. #healing is Jesus talking about healing; #healings are healing miracles.
- #popularity is any time the authors talk about "the crowds" or how Jesus was affected by his vast popularity. This is almost always in a negative context.
