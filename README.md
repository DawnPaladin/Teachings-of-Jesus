# Teachings of Jesus

Everyone these days wants Jesus on their side. Christians of every stripe claim that their favorite issue is the one Jesus cared about most. This repository is a very unscientific attempt to determine **what Jesus cared about most**, using what he *did* most and *talked* about most as a proxy.

## Results

### Jesus' favorite topics

- What Jesus talked about most was himself, God the Father, and the relationship between them.
- He talked a great deal about the [[Kingdom of Heaven]].
- He gave specific commands to his followers, about half of which are in the [[S54 Sermon on the Mount|Sermon on the Mount]].
- He spoke in many parables.

- And he spoke about the judgment to come.

## Working with this repository

First, install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Then [download a copy of this project](https://github.com/DawnPaladin/Teachings-of-Jesus/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it, and open it as an Obsidian vault. You can see the hashtags ordered by frequency in the "tags" pane on the right. In the file browser on the left, passages from the gospels are organized into folders according to the "phases" system used by [Harmony of the Gospels](http://harmony.bible/harmony-of-the-gospels/).

Please feel free to build on this work. [The World English Bible is public domain](https://ebible.org/web/webfaq.htm#MayIUse), and [so is this project](LICENSE.md). If you'd like to add or reorganize hashtags, feel free to either open a Pull Request on GitHub or email your updated vault to james/at/jamesharris.design.

## Methodology

I read through [this Harmony of the Gospels](http://harmony.bible/harmony-of-the-gospels/), copy-and-pasting each section into Markdown files in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. Each time Jesus mentioned a topic, I added a hashtag for that topic to that section's file.

Deciding how to "chunk" the hashtags is very subjective. When the same conversation is covered by multiple gospels, I will only tag it once. I also don't tag every single time Jesus says a word; I will usually tag once per paragraph at most. If Jesus wanders away from a topic and then comes back to it, I'll then tag it a second time. The goal isn't to deeply understand what Jesus is saying in any particular verse--it's to accumulate enough quantitative data that rough trends about his favorite topics will appear.

## Special hashtags

Most of the tags are topics of conversation, with a few exceptions:

- Jesus talks about God a lot. I organized this as #god/father, #god/jesus, and #god/holy-spirit. 
- #commands are direct instructions from Jesus for all of his followers. Instructions for a particular time and place (e.g. "bring me a donkey for the Triumphal Entry") are excluded.
- #miracles are sometimes an example of Jesus talking about miracles and sometimes a miracle happening. #healing is Jesus talking about healing; #healings are healing miracles.
- #popularity is any time the authors talk about "the crowds" or how Jesus was affected by his vast popularity. This is almost always in a negative context.
