**[Matthew 20:17-19](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+20.17-19&t=NIV)**
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, 18 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, 19 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up.”

**[Mark 10:32-34](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+10.32-34&t=NIV)**
32 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him. 33 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles. 34 They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”

**[Luke 18:31-34](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+18.31-34&t=NIV)**
31 He took the twelve aside, and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed. 32 For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. 33 They will scourge and kill him. On the third day, he will rise again.” 34 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t understand the things that were said.
