**[Luke 16:14-31](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+16.14-31&t=NIV)**

14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 15 He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight. #value #god

### Additional Teachings

16  “The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. 17  It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. #kingdom-of-heaven #gods-law #gospel

18  “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. #adultery 

### The Rich Man and Lazarus

19  “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20  At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21  and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. #wealth #greed #poverty

22  “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23  In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24  So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’ #hell #pride

25  “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26  And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’ #comfort #inversion #suffering

27  “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28  for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’

29  “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’ #scripture 

30  “ ‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’

31  “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’ ” #repentance #stubbornness
