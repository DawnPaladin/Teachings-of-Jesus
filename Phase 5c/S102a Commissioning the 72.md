**[Luke 10:1-16](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+10.1-16&t=NIV)**
1 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two[fn] others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go. 2 He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field. 3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. 4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.[^1] #commands #harvest #work #god/father #speech #evangelism #reliance #christians

5  “When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’ 6  If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you. 7  Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house. #blessings #peace #reliance #work

8  “When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you. 9  Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’ 10  But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, 11  ‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’ 12  I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. #healing #kingdom-of-heaven #judgment #hospitality 

13  “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14  But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. 15  And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades.[fn] #judgment 

16  “Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.” #god/jesus #god/father #christians
