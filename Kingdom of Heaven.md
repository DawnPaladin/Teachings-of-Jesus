[[S37 Nature of the Galilean Ministry]]

Jesus began to preach, and to say, “Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.” 

[[S54 Sermon on the Mount]]
3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. 10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. 1

“Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill. 18 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. 19 Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

“ ‘Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
10  your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
11  Give us today our daily bread.
12  And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13  And lead us not into temptation,[fn]
but deliver us from the evil one.[fn]’

But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22  Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 23  Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’

[[S64c Parable of spontaneous growth]]
He also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. 27 Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. 28 All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. 29 As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.” #harvest

[[S64d Parable of the weeds]]
24 Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. 26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.

27  “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’

28  “ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.

“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’

29  “ ‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. 30  Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’ ” #harvest

[[S64e Parable of the mustard seed]]
31 He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. 32 Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”

[[S64f Parable of the unleavened loaf]]
“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.”

[[S64h Parable of the hidden treasure]]
“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.

[[S64i Parable of the valuable pearl]]
“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, 46 who having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.

[[S64j Parable of the net]]
“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind, 48 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away. 49 So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous, 50 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”

[[S64k Parable of the house owner]]
“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”

[[S70b Appointing of the Twelve Apostles]]
These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. 6 Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. 7 As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,[fn] drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.

“Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts— 10  no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep. 11  Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave.

“So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. 27  What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs. 28  Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. 29  Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.[fn] 30  And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31  So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. 

32  “Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. 33  But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.
