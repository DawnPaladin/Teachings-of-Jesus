**[John 16:5-15](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+16.5-15&t=NIV)**  
but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ 6  Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things. 7  But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 8  When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: 9  about sin, because people do not believe in me; 10  about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; 11  and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned. #god/holy-spirit #guilt #sin #righteousness #judgment #satan

12  “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. 13  But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. 14  He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. 15  All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.” #gods-glory #god
