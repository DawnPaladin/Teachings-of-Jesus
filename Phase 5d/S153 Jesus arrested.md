[**Matthew 26:47-56**](http://harmony.bible/small-group-resources/harmony-bible-map/)

47 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

48 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”  
49 Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him.

50 Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  
51 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.

52 Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? #violence #angels

54 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” 55 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, “Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. #prophecy-fulfilled 

56 But all this has happened that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.

**[Mark 14:43-52](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+14.43-52&t=NIV)**

43 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.

44 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.” 45 When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him.

46 They laid their hands on him, and seized him.

47 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

48 Jesus answered them, “Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? 49 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me.

But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.” 50 They all left him, and fled. 51 A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him, 52 but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

**[Luke 22:47-53](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+22.47-53&t=NIV)**

47 While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them.

He came near to Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him, “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”

49 When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” 50 A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

51 But Jesus answered, “Let me at least do this”—and he touched his ear, and healed him. 52 Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? 53 When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”

**[John 18:2-12](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+18.2-12&t=NIV)**  
2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. 3 Judas then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to him, went out, and said to them, “Who are you looking for?” 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am he.” Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 6 When therefore he said to them, “I am he,” they went backward, and fell to the ground. 7 Again therefore he asked them, “Who are you looking for?” They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,” 9 that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, “Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none.”

10 Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 11 Jesus therefore said to Peter, “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?” 12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him,
