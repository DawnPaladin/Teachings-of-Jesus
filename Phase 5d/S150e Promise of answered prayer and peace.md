**[John 16:23-33](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+16.23-33&t=NIV)**
22 So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy. 23 In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. 24 Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete. #grief #joy #prayer

25  “Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father. 26  In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf. 27  No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. 28  I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.” #prophecy #god/father #love #god/jesus 

29 Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. 30 Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.”

31 “Do you now believe?” Jesus replied. 32 “A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me. #prophecy #god/jesus #god/father 

33  “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” #peace #god/jesus
