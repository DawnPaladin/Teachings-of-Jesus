**[Matthew 21:14-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/21/14-17/p1/s_950014)**
14 The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. 15 But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they were indignant. #healings #miracles 

16 “Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him.

“Yes,” replied Jesus, “have you never read,

“ ‘From the lips of children and infants
you, Lord, have called forth your praise’[fn]?” #praise #children

17 And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.

**[Luke 19:40-44](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/luk/19/40/p1/s_992040)**
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”

40 “I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.” #gods-glory 

41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it 42 and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes. 43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side. 44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God’s coming to you.” #prophecy #judgment #jerusalem #god/jesus
