31 When he had gone out, Jesus said,“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. 32 If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately. 33 Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I tell you. 34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another. 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” 36 Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you can’t follow now, but you will follow afterwards.”

27 Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ 28 However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” 29 But Peter said to him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”

30 Jesus said to him, “Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” 31 But he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing. #prophecy

33 He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”

34 He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”

35 He said to them, “When I sent you out without purse, wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.” 36 Then he said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. 37 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’ For that which concerns me has an end.” 38 They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” He said to them, “That is enough.” #prophecy-fulfilled
