**[Matthew 26:58](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+26.58&t=NIV), [69-75](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+26.69-75&t=NIV)**  
58 But Peter followed him from a distance,

to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.

69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying,

“You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!” 70 But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”

71 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.” 72 Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” 73 After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.” 74 Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately the rooster crowed. 75 Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and wept bitterly. #prophecy-fulfilled 

**[Mark 14:54](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+14.54&t=NIV), [66-72](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+14.66-72&t=NIV)**  
54 Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest.

He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire. 66 As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, 67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!” 68 But he denied it, saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.

69 The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.” 70 But he again denied it.

After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” 71 But he began to curse, and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!” 72 The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he wept.

**[Luke 22:54b-62](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+22.54b+62&t=NIV)**  
54b But Peter followed from a distance.

55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. 56 A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.” 57 He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” 58 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!” 59 After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” 60 But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!”

Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 61 The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.” 62 He went out, and wept bitterly.

**[John 18:15-18](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+18.15-18&t=NIV), [25-27](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+18.25-27&t=NIV)**  
15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. 17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?” He said, “I am not.” 18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.

25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You aren’t also one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.” 26 One of the servants of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?” 27 Peter therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
