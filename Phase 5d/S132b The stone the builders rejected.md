28  “What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’

29  “ ‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.

30  “Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.

31  “Which of the two did what his father wanted?”

“The first,” they answered. #obedience #parables 

Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. 32 For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. #kingdom-of-heaven #repentance #belief 

### The Parable of the Tenants

33  “Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. 34  When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. #parables 

35  “The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. 36  Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. 37  Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.

38  “But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’ 39  So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

40  “Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”

41 “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.” #judgment 

42 Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:

> “ ‘The stone the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone;
the Lord has done this,
and it is marvelous in our eyes’[fn]?
#scripture #prophecy-fulfilled #inversion 

43  “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. 44  Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”[fn] #kingdom-of-heaven #god/jesus #judgment #leaders 

45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them. 46 They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.

1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. #parables #kingdom-of-heaven   #hospitality 

4  “Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’

5  “But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business. 6  The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7  The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. #sin #judgment 

8  “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9  So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’ 10  So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. #grace

11  “But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12  He asked, ‘How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?’ The man was speechless.

13  “Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ #judgment 

14  “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”

**[Mark 12:1-12](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+12.1-12&t=NIV)**
1 Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. 2 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. 3 But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. 4 Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. 5 He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.

6  “He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

7  “But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ 8  So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.

9  “What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. 10  Haven’t you read this passage of Scripture:

>“ ‘The stone the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone;
11  the Lord has done this,
and it is marvelous in our eyes’[fn]?”

12 Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.

**[Luke 20:9-19](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+20.9-19&t=NIV)**
9 He began to tell the people this parable. “A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time. 

10 At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty. 11 He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. 12 He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out. 13 The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’ 14 “But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’ 15 They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them? 16 He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard that, they said, “May that never be!” 17 But he looked at them and said, “Then what is this that is written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected was made the chief cornerstone?’

18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.” 

19 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.
