**[Matthew 22:41-46](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Matthew+22.41-46&t=NIV)**
41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 42 “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” #god/jesus 

“The son of David,” they replied.

43 He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says,

>44  “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
“Sit at my right hand
until I put your enemies
under your feet.” ’[fn]

45 If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?” 46 No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.
