[**Matthew 24:42-44**](http://harmony.bible/small-group-resources/harmony-bible-map/) 

42 Watch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes. #second-coming #commands

43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 44 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come.

45 “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season? 46 Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes. 47 Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has. 48 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards, 50 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn’t expect it, and in an hour when he doesn’t know it, 51 and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be. #parables #second-coming #judgment 

1  “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2  Five of them were foolish and five were wise. 3  The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. 4  The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. 5  The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. #parables #kingdom-of-heaven #prophecy 

6  “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’

7  “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8  The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’

9  “ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’

10  “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. #judgment 

11  “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’

12  “But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’

13  “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.

### The Parable of the Bags of Gold

14  “Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them. 15  To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag,[fn] each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. 16  The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17  So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18  But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master’s money. #prophecy #parables #work #money

19  “After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20  The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.’

21  “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’ #eternal-reward 

22  “The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’

23  “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!’

24  “Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25  So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’

26  “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27  Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

28  “ ‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29  For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30  And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ #judgment 

**[Mark 13:33-37](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Mark+13.33-37&t=NIV)**   
33 Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don’t know when the time is. 34 “It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch. 35 Watch therefore, for you don’t know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning; 36 lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping. 37 What I tell you, I tell all: Watch.”

**[Luke 21:34-36](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=Luke+21.34-36&t=NIV)**   
34 “So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly. 35 For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth. 36 Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”
