**[John 1:35-51](http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/preSearch.cfm?Criteria=John+1.35-51&t=NIV)**  
35 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” 

37 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?” 

39 He said to them,“Come, and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour. 

40 One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 41 He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted, Christ). 42 He brought him to Jesus. 

Jesus looked at him, and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter). 

43 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him,“Follow me.” 

44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”

46 Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” 

Philip said to him, “Come and see.” 

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,“Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!” 

48 Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” 

Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 

49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!” 

50 Jesus answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” 51 He said to him,“Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”
